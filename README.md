In this case study, I will perform data analysis for a bike sharing company based out of Chicago.
I will analyze bike data to gain insight into how and when consumers are using the bikes.
The analysis will help guide future marketing strategies.
Along the way, I will perform numerous real-world tasks of a junior data analyst by following the steps of the data analysis process: Ask, Prepare, Process, Analyze, Share, and Act.
